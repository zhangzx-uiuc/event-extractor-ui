    " Ethical and legal issues in hiring Marinello",
    "It has been suggested that there is, or was at one time, some sort of delegates' motion which established a minimum period between the time someone could leave the EB and the time someone could be hired by the USCF.",
    "I don't know if this is so, and I really think it's sort of irrelevant.",
    "It's irrelevant because the REAL question is whether an active board member can, while on the board, arrange to be given money by the USCF.",
    "Of course it's in the bylaws that an active board member cannot be given money by the USCF while on the board.",
    "It ought to be pretty obvious that it would be entirely contrary to the spirit of this for an active board member to be money after leaving the board.",
    "Suppose, for example, there were to be a proposal to the effect that each EB member would be given $10,000 upon the expiration of his/her term.",
    "Clearly this would be a transparent attempt to evade the bylaws and would fail.",
    "If the board cannot vote to give themselves present money, they cannot vote to give themselves future money either.",
    "Furthermore, it doesn't matter whether this arrangement is embodied in an EB vote or not, or whether the discussion of the proposal takes place in a formal EB meeting or not.",
    "A board member, while on the board, is supposed to be representing the interests of the USCF, not feathering his/her nest, in the present or in the future.",
    "If a board member makes such arrangements, it is clearly an ethics violation, clearly a violation of the bylaws, possibly endangers our tax-exempt status, and is possibly a violation of law as well.",
    "The purpose of having a \"time limit\" would be as a mechanism to ensure compliance with the above principles; that is, you would have a time limit because it would reduce the likelihood that someone would be tempted to violate the above prohibition; it would give the voters time to elect a new EB that would consider the issues objectively.",
    "Of course, it is possible that someone could leave the board -without- ever having discussed being compensated by the board in the future, and that then the remaining members could, for good reason, hire that person.",
    "It would create questions among the suspicious - and avoiding this appearance of wrongdoing would be another good reason for a time limit - but it wouldn't automatically be an ethics or bylaws violation.",
    "But this is neither here nor there, because the fact that Randy Bauer is already talking about Beatriz Marinello as the USCF's new \"move coordinator\", whatever that involves, and whether or not it means that she would be the de facto interim ED, means that at some level and in some form these discussions HAVE already taken place, while Marinello is serving as President.",
    "I mean, it's conceivable that the other six have all gotten together in Marinello's absence and drafted her, but it also seems pretty clear that she has agreed to do it, and, if all the rumors are true and she steps down, it will be so that she can take on these new responsibilities.",
    "So the 'time limit' issue doesn't even come up.",
    "We pretty much know that Marinello, while on the board, has arranged to get future money from the USCF.",
    "So we already have a problem.",
    "If this is NOT a problem, I wish someone would explain to me why not.",
    "Now, Stan B. argues that Marinello's services are in fact indispensible as move coordinator, and that ethics standards are not a suicide pact, so that since we absolutely NEED her the EB has the right to go ahead and retain her.",
    "I agree with the principle.",
    "But I think that to make this argument work the EB would have to produce some evidence that Marinello really IS indispensible for this task.",
    "This would have to include evidence that the EB had considered all the alternatives, including:",
    "- delegating the whole thing to the Interim ED, which would be the normal practice in normal organizations with an ED",
    "- asking the Interim ED to designate someone from the New Windsor staff to act as move coordinator",
    "- asking the Interim ED to hire some other consultant with experience in office relocation to manage the job (there are such people)",
    "- conducting some kind of actual search for candidates for the position during the last two months since the move was decided upon",
    "If they did consider alternatives, it would also have to include evidence that Marinello has much more experience at relocating offices than other people, or is willing to do the job cheaper (although this wouldn't constitute being \"indispensible\" in my view).",
    "If, however, they just looked around the room and said \"who is going to manage this?\"",
    "and someone said, \"Beatriz, how about you?",
    "\", this does not constitute proof that her services are indispensible, and thus it wouldn't interfere with my belief that there has been an ethics violation and a bylaws violation.",
    "One very bad argument that was made by Kevin Bachler, which to be fair was surrounded by arguably better ones, was that since this board was elected, we should let them do as they please.",
    "Which is to say that there might as well not be bylaws, ethics standards, laws, etc., since an elected board is not bound by any of them.",
    "I think this idea should be rejected.",
    "Another argument, which is better but still disturbing, is that, yes, this is an ethics violation, and maybe worse, but it would only hurt the USCF to talk about it, and that only troublemakers like Sam Sloan, Larry Parr, and, I suppose, me, would talk about it, since doing so will obstruct the federation's plans, cause us to pay legal expenses, run the risk of our being stuck without any office space at all, cause people not to loan us money, and so forth.",
    "So we should all ignore this because it is realistic to do so.",
    "I'm not entirely unsympathetic to this, actually.",
    "But frankly I think that a whole lot of the problems the USCF has had over the years have had to do with well-intentioned people keeping secrets because bringing them out in the open would harm the USCF, and as a result we have awful habits which hurt the USCF even worse.",
    "But if we are going to talk about realism, here is another realistic concern: I predict that, if, in fact, the rumors about the agenda for the Florida meeting prove true, and Marinello resigns as President and is hired as move coordinator, the immediate result of this is that Sam Sloan will file another lawsuit (or amend his current complaint) charging the USCF EB members with self-dealing, violation of the USCF's own bylaws, and every other thing, report us to the IRS, and demand that all USCF moneys which might be used to paid Marinello be frozen.",
    "This is not based on any communication from Sam, direct or indirect.",
    "It is just logical.",
    "If he is willing to file a lawsuit on the basis of New York non-profit organization law, which might or might not be applicable to the USCF, why wouldn't he file a lawsuit on the basis of the USCF's violation of its own bylaws, which unquestionably ARE applicable to the USCF?",
    "I wrote a few days ago quoting my own employer association's attorney, who said that courts mostly let associations do what they want UNLESS they violate their own bylaws.",
    "It is irritating enough to get sued by Sam Sloan; imagine how irritating it would be to get sued by Sam Sloan and BEATEN by Sam Sloan because you have done something so egregious that a court is forced to agree with him.",

    "In IRS Publication 557, the sample draft articles of incorporation indicate that NO compensation may be paid to directors.",
    "In fairness, reimbursement of out-of-pocket expenses on behalf of the organization -- including travel and lodging to attend board meetings -- are allowed.",
