    "In India, Bechtel along with General Electric are the new owners of the notorious and currently defunct Enron power project.",
    "The Enron contract, which legally binds the Government of the State of Maharashtra to pay Enron a sum of 30 billion dollars, was the largest contract ever signed in India.",
    "Enron was not shy to boast about the millions of dollars it had spent to \"educate\" Indian politicians and bureaucrats.",
    "The Enron contract in Maharashtra, which was India's first 'fast-track' private power project, has come to be known as the most massive fraud in the country's history.",
    "( Enron was another of the Republican Party's major campaign contributors).",
    "The electricity that Enron produced was so exorbitant that the government decided it was cheaper not to buy electricity and pay Enron the mandatory fixed charges specified in the contract.",
    "This means that the government of one of the poorest countries in the world was paying Enron 220 million US dollars a year not to produce electricity!",
    "Now that Enron has ceased to exist, Bechtel and GE are suing the Indian Government for 5.6 billion US dollars.",
    "This is not even a minute fraction of the sum of money that they (or Enron ) actually invested in the project.",
    "Once more, it's a projection of profit they would have made had the project materialized.",

    "For a slightly different perspective:",
    "\"Maharashtra officials say the cost of power supplied by Enron is nearly double the tariff charged by Indian power producers, and used it as an excuse to stop paying state debts to the plant. \"",
    "\"Enron had signed a power purchase agreement with power utility MSEB eight years ago, under which a $3bn 2,182 Megawatt power plant was to be commissioned.",
    "But the project ran into trouble nearly two years ago with the Indian authorities beginning to delay payments saying Enron's power tariff was too high...Though Enron officials refuse to talk about the price they would be willing to sell their stake at, analysts say the US company is demanding about one billion dollars for its investments in India.",
    "So far it has only got offers of about half that amount from Indian companies and financial institutions, but Enron is unwilling to sell its stake at a price lower than the cost.",
    "In case no satisfactory offer comes from the Indian side, Enron will have little option but to go for international arbitration as their investments in the country were guaranteed by the Indian Government.",
    "But arbitration proceedings can be a long and messy affair.",
    "Analysts say both India and Enron have little to gain from a protracted legal battle.",
    "The best way out could be a compromise by which Enron gets less than what it is demanding and more than what the Indians are presently offering.",
    "IOW: No fraud, just a basic business dispute, in which the party reneging on its obligations is the gov't of Maharashtra.",
    "The Maharashtra officials are either incompetent fools, or worse- malicious fraudsters who conned an international comapny into building a state-of-the-art power plant for them at a cost of billions of dollars, and then refused payment, knowing the company has no legal recourse except lengthy international arbitration, and will likely sell the plant to them for a fraction of its true value.",

    "We *just* got back into Washington last evening, after our brief 5-day trip to London.",
    "Thanks for all of the responses to my earlier inquiries, I'm happy to report that everything went pretty well, but both my wife and I are pretty beat/tired.",
    "We got into Heathrow on Monday morning.",
    "At the airport, I got some cash from the Barclays ATM just outside the arrival area, as many have suggested.",
    "FYI, I just checked my bank account, and we got charged a $2.00 fee and the exchange rate was around $1.92/GPB.",
    "After that, we took the underground into London.",
    "Zone 1-6 all-day pass cost 5.40 GBP each.",
    "That was pretty easy... the most difficult part was finding the hotel once we finally got off at the final tube station.",
    "The hotel was nice enough to let us check in, even though we were a bit early (we got in around 12:30, normal check-in time was 14:30), which we were really grateful for, after dragging our bags for a couple of hours.",
    "After settling into the hotel room (my wife is an \"unpack everything-and-stow it\" type of person), we went to do a little exploring.",
    "Being that this was a holiday, a lot of the local places were closed (including restaurants in the hotel), but we found a kind of combo newsagent/foodstore nearby, and we picked up a 5 GBP calling card (for calling home) and some drinks (1.59 GPB for ~2 liter Pepsi light, .98 GBP for a ~2 liter water).",
    "It took us awhile, but we found a restaurant/pub (White Swan) that was open.",
    "It seemed like a kind of local place, and the woman that was running the place was very nice.",
    "When we walked in, we stood around waiting to be seated :), and she said \"this is a pub, sit anywhere, and order at the bar\".",
    "I gathered (from that and a few visits at other pubs) that that's the norm.",
    "Anyway, we had a nice late lunch: fish and chips (with \"mashed peas\") for me, and a beef pie for my wife.",
    "FYI, this was probably the most reasonable meal that we had during our whole visit.",
    "That night, we walked around the area around the Victoria underground station, because we were suppose to meet up with a tour the next morning.",
    "While there, we found a local Sainsbury (kind of a small supermarket) about 2 blocks from the underground station, and stocked up on some cheese, milk, and croissants.",
    "Prices here were a bit cheaper than the local foodstore, and during our trip, I made several trips here :).",
    "We weren't sure what we wanted to eat for dinner, so we just wandered around a bit, and finally ended up at a \"steakhouse\" near the station...big mistake.",
    "The food, service, and prices were very bad...",
    "I guess we should have figured that one out when 3 other parties walked out AFTER being seated, but unfortunately, we had already ordered, so we felt kind of obligated to finish.",
    "I don't know if this is the case with all \"steakhouses\", but we stayed away from them all after that :(.",
    "We took an all day bus tour (Evan Evans), including the London Eye.",
    "Took the underground to Victoria, and walked to the Victoria Coach Station (it's NOT the same :)).",
    "I thought that the tour was a pretty good way to get introduced to part of the city.",
    "We got to see a lot in a short time, including extended tours of Westminster (felt kind of strange walking over dead people) and the Tower of London (neat!).",
    "This tour included lunch at another pub near Trafalgar Square (more beef pies for us), and the tour guide was very good, and kind of funny.",
    "It was kind of like travelling with a \"grand dad\" and he did his best to keep us all together.",
    "At the end of the land tour, we went on ride on one of the Thames cruise boats (warning, it is FREEZING on the top deck...), and then a ride on the London Eye.",
    "All in all, recommended, but afterwards, both my wife and I agreed that an \"all-day\" tour was too exhausting (even on a bus tour, you have to do a LOT of walking especially getting to the Changing of the Guards and at the London Tower), and we probably would've preferred breaking it into 2 1/2 day tours.",
    "We also took one of the hop-on/hop-off bus tours (the \"Original\") on one of the other day, as we thought it was the easiest way to get around to the places that we wanted to re-visit.",
    "A couple of comments: take the one with the live guide if you can, as it's much more interesting than the ones with the recorded commentary (you can ask questions).",
    "Also, if you want to get a seat on the top deck, take one of the earlier buses, as at least when we were there, it was impossible to get a seat on top later in the day, and you can't see much from the lower (enclosed) deck (but it's much warmer :)!",
    ").",
    "We had been buying the 2-zone all-day tube passes (4.20 GBP each) everyday, just to get around to dinner and shopping on our own, but by the time this was all over, my wife didn't feel like taking the underground back to Heathrow, so we had asked the hotel conceierge to make a reservation on an airport bus (15 GBP each), but he instead offered that he could get us a private car direct to the airport for 35 GBP, which is what we did.",
    "This was perfect, because it got us door-to-door from the hotel to LHR Terminal 3 with no hassles at all.",
    "I wouldn't have done that from LHR to the hotel, but since the concierge was arranging it, I felt that it'd be safe, and the driver turned out to be pretty nice.",
    "Overall, it was an enjoyable, but really exhausting trip (we live in the suburbs, so I guess we're not use to walking everywhere).",
    "Luckily this wasn't a \"shopping\" trip, because things are (at least from Americans) really expensive.",
    "I think that if I was dealing in GPBs all the time, it wouldn't seem so bad, but I remember sitting at the ice cream (\"gelato\"?)",

    " There is one Carousel organization again",
    "I just received the latest issue of Merry-Go-Roundup, the quarterly publication of the National Carousel Association .",
    "In it was a blurb reporting that the American Carousel Society had recently disbanded.",
    "Some of you may be wondering why there were two carousel organizations in the first place.",
    "The National Carousel Association was founded in the early 1970's by a group of art historians and collectors, including Frederick Fried, author of the 1964 book \"A Pictorial History of The Carousel\" that single-handedly gave the classic hand-carved wooden carousel the respect and appreciation it deserved.",
    "Other founders included Charlotte Dinger, who was already a major collector of carousel artwork at the time.",
    "The purpose of the NCA is \"to promote conservation, appreciation, knowledge and enjoyment of the art of the classic wooden carousel and especially the preservation of complete wooden carousels.\"",
    "The organization attracted a wide range of members, including carousel enthusiasts, owners/operators, theme and amusement parks, museums, libraries, those in the entertainment/recreation industry, art collectors and even auction houses, among others.",
    "It was the presence of these last two named groups that would eventually stir up controversy.",
    "Thanks in large part to the NCA, the art of the carousel was receiving a lot of public attention and appreciation that it had not enjoyed before.",
    "However, this new and brighter spotlight on these antique rides also had the unfortunate effect of enhancing the collectibility and monetary value of operational carousels.",
    "They had become worth more money dead (i.e.",
    "in pieces) than alive (i.e.",
    "functioning).",
    "As such, during the 1980's many beautiful and unique wooden carousels would be broken up at the auction block, as owners rushed to cash in on the antique marketplace.",
    "The liability insurance crisis further aggravated the situation, as amusement park operators sought to cut their losses, while at the same time liquidate underperforming carousels to raise capital for the purchase of newer and more profitable (thrill) rides.",
    "Some collectors of carousel art and auction houses were accused of using their NCA affiliation to gain information about vintage carousels that they could target for breakup to their own personal profit, a practice certainly contrary to the stated goals of the organization.",
    "The increasing rift between the \"preservationists\" and \"collectors\" would eventually boil over into an internal political struggle that caused many in the collectors faction of the NCA to walk out of the group, including founders such as Charlotte Dinger and others.",
    "The preservationists would chose to remain with the NCA, including Fred Fried.",
    "At this time in the late 1970's, carousel artwork collector and printer Marge Swenson was the editor of the NCA's Merry-Go-Roundup publication.",
    "The political struggle that occurred within the NCA resulted in two slates of officers being presented for approval to the membership, something that was not supposed to happen.",
    "A thicker-than-usual issue of the Roundup would be filled with accusations from both factions in the group each accusing the other of improper behavior.",
    "Swenson herself would also leave the NCA.",
    "Not much later, she began publishing her own magazine called \"Carousel Art\", which was essentially a scholarly photo album depicting different carvers and styles each month.",
    "Meanwhile, those collectors who left the National Carousel Association banded together to form the American Carousel Society (ACS), whose stated aims of carousel preservation also recognized collectors as a positive asset towards that goal.",
    "For the next couple of decades, the two carousel organizations would co-exist, each attracting its share of members.",
    "Some would actually join both groups, and even attend both of their annual conventions.",
    "During the mid-1980's Walter Louck would begin publishing \"The Carousel Trader\", later renamed \"The Carousel News & Trader\".",
    "This monthly magazine would cover all angles and sides of the story of the carousel and be well received by all carousel enthusiasts.",
    "About a decade later, Carousel Art would suddenly cease publication.",
    "The NCA would continue to issue the Roundup to its members.",
    "The mid to late 1990's saw the passing of NCA founder Fred Fried, and also that of Charlotte Dinger, both who represented the two opposite points of view in the carousel preservation debate.",
    "Coincidentally and amazingly, the art of building hand-carved carousels (and even bandorgans) has been revived, with firms such as Carousel Works and Carousel Magic again building the popular rides in classic design.",
    "This development seems to have greatly alleviated the antique marketplace pressures that have doomed so many legacy wooden carousels over the past several decades.",
    "The turn of the new millenium actually witnessesed a thaw in the relationship between the National Carousel Association and American Carousel Society, as newer and younger leadership took over from the founding generation.",
    "The two groups decided that the bickering between them was wasteful, conterproductive and pointless.",
    "There was talk of a (re)merger but the regulations governing non-profits prevented that.",
    "However, it was decided that NCA and ACS hold joint conventions to save on costs to both the clubs and the members.",
    "Just within the past couple of months though, the American Carousel Society had determined that they did not have the funding to continue with the operation of their organization and officially ceased to exist.",
    "So now, once again there is a single nationwide organization to join if you love carousels!",

    "I believe you had said that you gave him the shares in February 2004 but that the discharge didn't come until June of 2004.",
    "That means that he received the shares while he was still in bankruptcy, which means that the shares were potentially assets that the trustee could use to pay off creditors.",
    "A bankruptcy case doesn't close until you get the discharge order, and until then everything that the debtor receives is fair game for the trustee.",
    "If the trustee was informed of the shares and did nothing about it, you are more likely than not ok, but if the trustee wasn't informed of the fact directly, then you may be in trouble.",
    "If, however, your uncle received the shares after he obtained an order of discharge from the bankruptcy court, then as a general matter the creditors cannot go after the shares, unless they can prove that there was collusion between you and your uncle to hide his assets from them (e.g., by putting his assets in the corporation's name and then waiting until after the bankruptcy to transfer the shares to him).",

    "With the deaths of many of the idealistic leaders who had led Japan's rise to international prominence, and the refusal of the US to intervene in Asian affairs, in addition to the Bolshevik revolution and the stripping of possessions from Germany, Britain found herself alone in dealing with an increasingly aggressive Japan in the area.",

    "Let's see...",
    "There two main qualities to be desired in a Commander-in-Chief, Generalship and Leadership.",
    "Because in the United States the Commander-in-Chief is a purely political post, generalship is usually undertaken by the generals proper under the Commander-in-Chief, provided it is understood that the Commander-in-Chief is ultimately responsible and accountable for the outcomes of his general's generalship.",
    "Generalship involves the technical skills of intelligence gathering, strategic and tactical planning, and the communication of orders.",
    "Leadership can be less rigidly defined and is concerned less with coordination than motivation and how a commander seeks to inspire his men to fight harder and endure worse privations in order to beat the enemy.",
    "President Bush generalship has proven deficient.",
    "His planning for the war was inadequate and his monitoring of the war after the invasion failed to correct course in the face of the change in circumstances brought by a strong and unexpected insurgency.",
    "The Commander-in-Chief's generalship can suffice to motivate men if they are higly confident that he is a very capable and skilled general.",
    "Eisenhower was in that position.",
    "That has not been the case with President Bush, who unleashed hell acting on faulty intelligence, failed to find any WMD, and left our boys at war wanting for armor.",
    "That is not the sort of generalship that on rational grounds alone motivates men to march to possible death.",
    "Men unmotivated by bad generalship can still be motivated by exceptional leadership.",
    "In theory, motivation is best carried out by a commander fighting alongside his men.",
    "Make no mistake, even when we don't desire a president with a preference for personal combat, the need for a commander to be seen to share dangers with his men is as imperative today as it was in times of Alexander of Macedon.",
    "That's why we look at the military record of our leaders.",
    "John Kennedy, George H. Bush, and even John Kerry, the loser, had distinguished military careers that were apt substitutes for leading men in battle.",
    "The knowledge that the Commander-in-Chief once faced grave danger in war bravely can be the animating spirit of troops facing the same dangers.",
    "George W. Bush has no distinguished military career.",
    "In fact, CBS and carrier landings notwithstanding, there is every indication that in the peak of youth he avoided the dangers of war as much as he could.",
    "That is not the sort of leadership that on emotional grounds alone motivates men to march to possible death.",
    "Some might say that George W. Bush is neither a general nor a soldier, he is a politician.",
    "He is in charge of Grand Strategy and he delegates the rest.",
    "True.",
    "But as Commander-in-Chief he is the Ultimate General and the First Soldier.",
    "George W. Bush, the Politician, is not very good at grand strategy either.",
    "The aim of grand strategy is a prosperous and secure peace, and by his several blunders over the psychology of his opponents, the political and economic effects of his actions, and the failure to erradicate terrorism and even capture he most wanted terrorist, George W. Bush, he has failed to realize the aim of grand strategy.",
    "I'll be glad if Iraq becomes a truly democratic country.",
    "But will it?",
    "And at what price?",
    "Are you willing to pay with a deficit of billions, thousands of Americans dead or badly wounded, and the unmeasurable disruption that a foreign war causes to the life of our nation at all levels, for each country in the world that is in the grip of a tyrant?",
    "I am not.",
    "Let those countries grow a generation with the guts and the willingness to originate democratic change and I'll support joining other nations to back the ef.",
    "But unilaterally, or worse leading a coalition featuring tyrannies, effect such change remains a bad idea, Iraq's elections notwithstanding.",
    "George W. Bush didn't do well in the industrial private sector where success is measured by return on investment.",
    "Government suits such a man perfectly; there is no balance sheet to worry about.",
    "There is every indication that the new rulers of Iraq will do business as usual under a democratic varnish.",
    "The interim government didn't hesitate to torture opponents, just like Saddam did.",
    "the Shiites will be no different.",
    "That will be our return on investment.",

    "Monday, July 4th - Hang around Boston and stay with friends",
    "Tuesday, July 5th - Leave early and drive to Niagara Falls, NY - 467 miles - Stay in Niagara Falls",
    "Wednesday, July 6th - Leave from Niagara Falls and drive to Toronto, On - 85 miles - Drive back to Niagara Falls that evening - 85 miles - Stay in Niagara Falls",
    "Thursday, July 7th - Leave Niagara Falls and drive to Red Bank, NY - 435 miles - Stay in Red Bank for the night - We want to hit-up Jay and Silent Bob's Silent Stash",
    "Friday, July 8th - Drive back to Boston passing through New York -- do whatever -- 262 Miles from Red Banks to Boston but add whatever miles from New York - Stay the night with friends in Boston",
    "Saturday, July 9th - Fly back to Austin",
    "I figure staying in Red Bank, NJ, which isn't far from NYC, is cheaper then staying in the city.",
    "Plus while driving back north to Boston we can spend the day in NYC.",
    "I know there's WAY too much to do, but I have another friend who works at the MET I'll try to hook-up with.",
    "We'll plan our few hours in NYC wisely.",
    "Also we're hanging in Boston for so many nights to visit with the friends there and hit the sights in that area.",
    "Also this is a vacation, so we hope to spend some time just chilling.",
    "Any suggestions on changes?",
    "We have 3 people going, and Expedia shows the flight (round trip) and a rental car with unlimited miles being $1430, plus I'm figuring about $150 for gas and at $120 a night for hotel that's $360 total for that.",
    "So total cost (without food, spending cash, parking, toll roads, etc) is $1910 or about $637 each.",
    "I'm figuring about $850 per person should be plenty for everything -- and that's not bad for 7 nights in New Enland with all the stuff we're planning.",

    "I know the bulk of our trip is in Boston, but we have friends living up there we hope to spend a few days with visiting.",
    "The trip is both to visit with them and to spend time around New England.",
    "As for gas, what is the going rate for gas right now in New England?",
    "Here in Texas it's around $1.60-$1.75 for Reg Unleadded, but i'm figuring $1.90 a gallon.",
    "Is this not accurate?",
    "Here's how I figured the price I'm factoring in -- Boston to Niagara Falls - 467 Miles Niagara Falls to Toronto - 85 Miles and 85 Miles back Niagara Falls to Red Bank, NJ - 435 Miles Red Bank, NJ to Boston (plus spending some time in NYC) - 262",
    "Total is 1334, but I'm figuring 1500 with some extra for around NYC and various towns we visit.",
    "We're getting a mid-sized vehicle, so if the car gets 20 mpg that's 75 gallons used.",
    "This times $1.90 is $145.50 or around that.",
    "Even if gas is $2.00 a gallon that's still only around $150, so I think $200+ for gas is a rather high estimate.",
    "Also is it possible to take a train from Boston to NYC?",
    "If so how does that work or what's the cost?",
    "I am from Texas where we drive everywhere, and I've never even set foot on a train -- so forgive me if this is a weird question :)",

    "Well, they are close enough up to Baghdad now so that the supply line issue is probably not a big one since they had time to restock, food, fuel and ammunition.",
    "So, probably the main thing is combing through the rubble that the air force has left of these Republican Guard divisions to make sure there are no strong points that you leave behind, that could threaten your lines of supply once they get past.",
    "Once they are satisfied they are through all that, I would imaging there will be a pause while they start to reconnoiter into Baghdad, probing hard to see how much resistance there really is.",
    " O'BRIEN",

    "And besides, as soon as you get control of it you'd be able to start using it for air operations, and put a survey team in there as soon as it's secured, and then start using it for helicopter operations, haul forward some big bladders of fuel to refuel helicopters and rearm them and things like that.",
    "And if the front stabilizes between there and the downtown Baghdad, they'll start using it for a fixed wing aircraft as well.",

    "Control of these highways will be crucial won't it?",
    " LANG",
    "Yeah, these are the high-speed approaches into the heart of the city and armored forces like the 3rd Mechanized Infantry Division just love high-speed approaches.",
    "They will try to go down those things, cutting the city up into sectors as best they can, and then work on the specific sectors of the city they think are a key terrain.",

    "Well, it depends on the attitude of the populous, which is not clear yet.",
    "If the population, in fact, or at least a big part of them like the Shia half of the population, if they want to be liberated, then you can control them with a fairly small force.",
    "If, in fact, a lot of people in the city don't want to be liberated and you're never going to know that until you try, then you're going to need a much larger force, and we might end up waiting a couple of weeks for reinforcements.",
    " O'BRIEN",
    "Based on what you've seen so far, what is your sense of that?",
    "The Shias are a bit gun shy, if you will, in the south because of what happened in 1991.",
    "They rose up, didn't get American support.",
    "Do you suppose it will be a different story in Baghdad?",
    "Is there a lot of latent hatred for Saddam Hussein that will come out?",
    " LANG",
    "Yes, there is, but these folks are going to be mighty cautious.",
    "They have a long history of being kicked around by the Sunni Arab population of central Iraq.",
    "And they don't have any particular reason to trust us, so far.",
    "So they'll wait and see what happens.",

    "Are you among those who are beginning to conclude that, when all the dust settles, the U.S. may not find weapons of mass destruction in Iraq?",
    " SEN. RICHARD LUGAR (R), INDIANA",
    "No, I concur with Secretary Powell, Secretary Rumsfeld, the president, that weapons of mass destruction are there, and likewise, that we will be led to them by people knowledgeable in the country as to where they are.",
    "What form we may find them and what traces of destruction and all the rest of it will be very interesting and, likewise, the intellectual capital that is there to produce more.",
    "Because not much else is -- you don't need much to get it going again.",
    "And that, I think, we have to be working with these people who are in the business to make sure they don't re-enter the business, much as we did with Russian scientists under the Nunn-Lugar program.",

    "What about you, Senator Dodd, do you believe, in the end, they will find weapons of mass destruction?",
    " SEN. CHRISTOPHER DODD (D), CONNECTICUT",
    "I have no evidence to the contrary.",
    "And certainly, they have used them in the past.",
    "There's no doubt about that at all, both in Iran and against the Kurdish population.",
    "So, whether or not they find them in the exact form that many would assume they would be the case -- possibly some got out of the country.",
    "It wouldn't surprise me to hear that.",
    "But I'm going to work on the assumption, based on the intelligence that has been gathered, that the weapons of mass destruction existed.",
    " BLITZER",
    "What if they don't?",
    " DODD",
    "Well, you know, they've used it in the past, and I think the point that Senator Lugar just made -- certainly having the intellectual capacity to do this was proven already by the fact they've used them in the past.",
    "So, I wouldn't dwell on that point specifically, because Saddam Hussein clearly was a producer and a user of biological and chemical weapons.",
    "He clearly was on the track to acquire a nuclear capacity, and the world is a safer place today because he's not ruling Iraq.",
    " BLITZER",
    "Will the U.S. lose creditability, Mr. Chairman, if, if the U.S. finds no hard evidence, no so-called smoking gun?",
    " LUGAR",
    "No, we have full credibility in Iraq.",
    "We've prosecuted with the alliance a successful liberation of the Iraqi people, and we have clearly caused Saddam to destroy weapons of mass destruction, or at least to suppress evidence of them.",
    "That is a victory of sorts.This is a facet that's important.",
    "It's important in the war against terrorism that we rout out whatever is there and, likewise, the people involved, because they might help supply al Qaeda or other terrorists along the trail.",
    " BLITZER",
    "Senator Dodd, how important is it for the U.S. to conclusively learn what happened to Saddam Hussein?",
    " DODD",
    "Well, it's important.",
    "But I don't think it's as important as finding Osama bin Laden, for the simple reason that I don't think Saddam Hussein today poses any threat, wherever he is.",
    "If he is alive, obviously, he doesn't pose the kind of threat that an Osama bin Laden does with his cellular network around the world to reactivate al Qaeda and international terrorism.",
    "So, it would certainly be good to know where he is.",
    "It would be, certainly, to know, to apprehend him, to bring him before a court of justice.",
    "But I don't think it's absolutely critical for the ultimate success of this mission that we apprehend him or find out what happened to him.",
    " BLITZER",
    "And you agree with that assessment, Mr. Chairman?",
    " LUGAR",
    "Yes, I think that Senator Dodd is right on.",
    " BLITZER",
    "What about the length of the U.S. military presence in Iraq, Senator Lugar?",
    "How long do you anticipate large numbers of U.S. troops will remain there?",
    " LUGAR",
    "Well, I was heartened by what Secretary Rumsfeld told you in the last interview, that we will have troops there as long as necessary, but no longer than necessary.",
    "I think that's a pretty good way to state it.",
    "My own view is that the security of the country clearly is our responsibility presently.",
    "We are trying to pass that on to others.",
    "Likewise, the other government's procedures, the fledgling beginnings on democracy, and all the rest.",
    "But that's going to require an undergirding.",
    "Now, in due course, as everybody points out, we may get help from other countries.",
    "We may bring in NATO allies or the United Nations or other people in the Arab world.",
    "That would be helpful.",
    "But for the moment, this is our responsibility.",
    "And we ought not to be having large debates about how rapidly we move out.",
    "And I was upset, in a way, to hear reports that by the fall, three divisions out of five would be gone.",
    "I think Secretary Rumsfeld disabused us of that today.",
    " BLITZER",
    "And what about you, Senator Dodd, not only the length of time, but the cost to U.S. taxpayers?",
    "Have you been given any ballpark estimate what this is going to cost the United States?",
    " DODD",
    "No.",
    "Well, what we've heard the numbers of reconstruction running around $100 billion.",
    "We put $2.5 billion in, in the last supplemental appropriations bill.",
    "So it's going to be costly.",
    "These RFPs, these seeking bids on various contracts are rather costly, and so it's going to be expensive.",
    "And clearly the responsibility is going to fall principally on the United States.",
    "Now, I would hope that sooner rather than later we could see a civilian government emerge in Iraq, a democratically elected one, that there'd be more cooperation from the international community, on both the peacekeeping side as well as the political restructuring that's necessary in Iraq.",
    "And to the extent we can move that along more quickly, I think we're all going to be better off.",

    " BLITZER",
    "Senator Lugar, we have to take a quick break, but before we do, I wanted to just ask you, the U.N. role -- you say there could be a U.N. role.",
    "Do you specifically want the United Nations to have some sort of peacekeeping role there?",
    "And secondarily, what about countries like France, Germany, and Russia, which opposed the Bush administration's war plans, do you want them shut out?",
    " LUGAR",
    "No, I don't want anybody shut out.",
    "And I do hope the United Nations will play a vital role in Iraq, whether it be in peacekeeping or various other ways, and I hope that that will occur soon.",
    "I think we really need an internationalization of the process, for the very reasons that Senator Dodd pointed out.",

    "It also takes time to figure out what law enforcement process might be appropriate, and what Colin and I have been concerned about, both of us, is that it's taking so long.",
    "There are a number of countries, and the Department of State has the responsibility of dealing with those countries, that have foreign nationals in Gitmo, in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, being detained, and those countries, understandably, would like to know when they could have those people.So the inter-agency process takes a great deal of time.",

    "There's no question but that the troops, the young men and women, did such a superb job that there has to be a way to honor them, and there will be.",
    "And General Franks and his team have done just a superb job for our country and for the world, and indeed for the Iraqi people, who have been liberated.",
    "What's the best way to do that?",
    "In the case of 1991, the task was to go in and get them out of Kuwait, and they did it, and they were properly greeted coming back to the United States.",
    "In this instance, it was a very different task.",
    "It was to remove that regime, and it's part of a global war on terrorism that is not over.",
    "We still have to face the problem of a number of global terrorist networks and terrorist states that exist, that work with those global networks.",
    "And on the one hand we will, in fact, find a way to honor the courage and dedication and talent of these young men and women, and we'll do it well.",
    "Whether it will be modeled off the 1991 thing, I don't know.",
    "I kind of doubt it, because it's such a different circumstance.",

    "I'm not one who speculates about things like that.",
    "I know that back in the 1990s, in the Clinton administration, Secretary Perry called in the former secretaries of defense, and we had a discussion, and they clearly had teed up a military option that they were considering, and they then at a certain moment were able to do some things that persuaded them that that was not appropriate.",

    " POLLACK",
    "Well, if it's true and obviously we don't know just yet but if it's true, it is very significant because it's effectively the Iraqis admitting that many of the civilian casualties that we've seen over the last few days may in fact have been caused by Iraqi surface to air missiles falling back to ground in residential areas.",

    "Those who don't have the requisite faith will point to these factors as proof that the business is dying and the movie business in general will need a pretty significant overhaul before it can make profits.",
    "Movie rentals are no longer a cheap alternative to other ways of viewing films; they're the stodgy, expensive way.",
    "There aren't any pure-play buys on this theory, but someone who believes it might overweight their portfolio in cable companies -- if they purchased any media stocks at all.",

    "For movies, the video rental store is just one way to get videos out there (though at 45-55% of studio revenues, it's a much more important one than people think).",
    "But given the high valuations ascribed to bricks-and-mortar-and-dead tree booksellers like Barnes and Noble , Borders , and to a much lesser extent Books-A-Million , surely there's room for a Blockbuster , along with a Movie Gallery or two.",
    "The latter, at least, still has room to grow.",
    "By focusing on smaller, rural communities (preferably the sort that considers DSL 'newfangled') they're WalMarting WalMart -- competing with Walmart's awful in-store video rentals by offering better selection and much lower prices.",
    "The movie business is changing dramatically as the potential for online distribution grows, but like every other business it leaves lots of room for traditional operators to operate at traditional (read: high) profits.",
    "The aggressive bidding war for Hollywood Video , featuring two of their competitors, a buyout shop, and one of the savviest raiders around, is proof that some people still think these stores are worth something.",

    "WASHINGTON _ Having punched through severely depleted Republican Guard divisions that formed Baghdad's outer defensive ring, U.S. Army and Marine forces are likely to pause again to test the Iraqi capital's inner defenses and waall but evaporated under the weight of the U.S. assault.",
    "Their collapse left the U.S. troops less than 20 miles from Saddam Hussein's capital.",
    "Bet`fow Central Command chief Gen. Tommy Franks and his field commanders face a big decision _ whether to rush into the city of 5 million where Hussein's regime has gathered its most-trusted forces or wait and see if the war can be won without paying the price of street-to-street urban fighting.",
    "``We are expectingn or at least planning for, a very difficult fight ahead,'' Gen. Stanley McChrystal said at the Pentagon Tuesday.",
    "``We are not expecting to drive into Baghdad suddenly and seize it.''",
    "Instead of an all-out assault, analysts expect the United States to follow the example of British forces outside the southern Iraqi city of Basra.",
    "They are likely to mount small probing patrols into the city to determine the level of Iraqi resistance.",
    "If these patrols meet little opposition, thousands of troops could rush into the city.",
    "If the Iraqis respond forcefully, the Army and Marine units could withdraw and await the 4th Mechanized Infantry Division, which will soon start moving north from Kuwait.",
    "While they wait, the forces would try to determine where Iraqi strong points are within the city and where Hussein might be, if he is still alive.",
    "``The Basra model will work for a while, at least until you see problems with food and water for civilians in the city,'' said Lawrence Korb, an analyst at the Council on Foreign Relations who was assistant defense secretary under former President Ronald Reagan.",
    "``Before going in (with a full assault), you have to decide if it's worth the risks, and ... you have to know who's there in the way of Iraqi forces and the amount of potential damage to civilians,'' he said.",
    "The administration has said it wants to minimize casualties to Iraqi civilians, which makes the British experience around Basra instructive, the analysts said.",
    "The British have been outside the city of 1.5 million for more than a week.",
    "Thousands of refugees have fled the city, apparently providing information to the British that has led to raids on military and Baath Party sites in the city.",
    "``The key endgame may be whether the U.S. can parse out the key regime centers of power in Baghdad and attack them without having to fight into the city, or at least locate them well enough to atman of the Center for Strategic and International Studies said in his daily war report.",
    "U.S. strategists say that Hussein, if he is still alive and in control of his forces, might like a bloody battle in Baghdad because such fighting could cause heavy U.S. casualties.",
    "His last hope for survival might be that the United States loses its taste for such losses and forces President Bush to negotiate a compromise that would allow Hussein and his family to keep power in Baghdad.",
    "But Michael O'Hanlon of the Brookings Institution in Washington said the apparent collapse of Republican Guard resistance could deprive Hussein of much of the wallop he was counting on in the city.",
    "``If U.S. forces seriously degrade Iraq's half-dozen Republican Guard divisions before that final battle, and only have to face perhaps 30,000 Special Republican Guard, fedayeen, and related personnel, the task will not be as hard as it might have been,'' he said.",
    "While two guard divisions have apparently been smashed, there are three others in the Baghdad area.",
    "A sixth remains in northern Iraq.",
    "Cordesman said it seems the guards have been reinforced by units from the regular Iraqi army, which is generally viewed as less reliable.",
    "This shows the Iraqi military's growing weakness, he said.",
    "``The Republican Guard has taken a massive hammering at every level and is now scattered and deploying somewhat erratically at the brigade level,'' he said.",
    "The Iraqis still haven't used chemical weapons, even though many experts feared such attacks as the U.S. troops neared Baghdad.",
    "Korb, who's convinced Hussein has stocks of chemical weapons he never reported to U.N. inspectors, said he wouldn't be surprised if Hussein tried to use them.",
    "But he also said, ``He may destroy them to embarrass us,'' to show the world he never had such weapons and that Bush invaded for no reason other than aggression.",
    "The U.S. forces zeroing in on Baghdad _ the 1st Marine Division from the east and the Army's 3rd Mechanized Infantry Division _ are trained in urban warfare.",
    "But in such close-quarters fighting, they would lose much of the technological advantage of their air supremacy, which would have to be curtailed because bombing in a city can cause large civilian casualties.",
    "However, Baghdad from the air looks like Los Angeles _ wide, straight boulevards intersected by side streets in a grid pattern.",
    "``Our forces would be capable of dealing with it reasonably.",
    "But there would be lots of casualties on all sides,'' Korb said.",
    "KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP)",
    "A state security court suspended a newspaper critical of the government Saturday after convicting it of publishing religiously inflammatory material, the newspaper's lawyer said.",
    "The Khartoum Monitor may not appear for two months and must pay a fine of 1 million Sudanese pounds (about US$400), lawyer Ngor Olang Ngor told The Associated Press.",
    "Failure to pay the fine would result in a two-month extension of the suspension.",
    "The sentence was the latest in a series of state actions against the Monitor, the only English language daily in Sudan and a leading critic of conditions in the south of the country, where a civil war has been waged for 20 years.",
    "Ngor said the paper would pay the fine but it would also appeal the verdict.",
    "The court ruling stated that the verdict and sentence would be submitted to the National Press Council, a government-appointed body, for approval, Ngor said.",
    "The secretary general of the National Press Council, Hashim el-Jazz, did not answer repeated calls to his cell phone on Saturday.",
    "The court convicted the paper of violating article 25 of the Press Law, which prohibits the publication of material that defames religion or incites religiously unacceptable activity.",
    "The charges arose from letters-to-the-editor published last month that dealt with religion.",
    "One letter claimed that alcohol was not prohibited by Islam.",
    "Earlier this week, security police detained the Monitor's managing editor, Nhial Bol, for 24 hours.",
    "On his release, he was charged with incitement of public discord for publishing the letters.",
    "Sudan has an Islamic-orientated government and a substantial Christian minority.",
    "In a separate action against the Monitor, security officials went to its editorial offices on Thursday night and told the management that it was being closed until it paid a fine of 15 million Sudanese pounds (about US$6,000) that was outstanding from a court conviction last year.",
    "The Monitor did not appear Friday and its offices were closed.",
    "In last year's trial, the paper was convicted of defaming the government for publishing that trains running to and from southern Sudan were used to transport abducted women and children.",

    "At the site, equipment has been set up to test conventional explosives that, when detonated, could compress a plutonium core and set onfe nuclear explosion.",
    "[oMa intelligence officials believe that the existence of the testing range is evidence that the country intends to manufacture much more sophisticated weapons that would be light enough to put onto its growing arsenal of medium- and long-range missiles.",

    "The accident occurred ``recently'' in Chinese waters east of the Neichangshan islands, the brief Chinese-language report said.",
    "The islands are in the Yellow Sea, between the northeastern province of Liaoning and North Korea.",
    "The submarine was on an exercise when the accident occurred, and ``because of a mechanical malfunction, the 70 crew members on board died,'' the Xinhua report said.",
    "It did not give further details or say how the crew died.",
    "The vessel already has been towed back to an unidentified port, Xinhua said.",
    "It said the hull number was 361, which military analysts said appeared to make it a Ming-class submarine, a vessel used for patrols and coastal defense.",
    "The announcement was unusual for a communist government that rarely acknowledges military accidents.",
    "It was the first time China has announced a fatal submarine mishap, said Bernard Cole, a professor at the U.N. National War College in Washington and a specialist on the Chinese navy.",
    "``There have been rumors going around about the loss of submarines, but this is the first fatal accident that I know of,'' said Cole.",
    "China's military, which has a tradition of secrecy, did not comment about the accident Friday night.",
    "Foreign military analysts said it would be highly unusual for an accident to kill a whole submarine crew while still allowing the vessel to be recovered.",
    "They suggested possible causes ranging from a sinking in shallow water to a disaster that flooded the vessel with toxic chemical fumes.",
    "Michael McGinty, an expert on the Chinese navy from the Royal United Services Institute for Defense Studies in London, said that the mishap likely happened while the submarine was on the surface.",
    "If the accident happened when the vessel was underwater, it was less likely that China could have recovered it, said McGinty, a former British submariner.",
    "``For an accident to have been so catastrophic when the submarine was on the surface, I find it a very mysterious thing,'' he said.",
    "McGinty said that the submarine's batteries might have leaked acid that mixed with seawater, creating toxic chlorine gas that killed the crew.",
    "The torpedoes might have leaked propellant that poisoned the crew, he said.",
    "The accident could have occurred as long ago as March, said Cole, a former U.S. Navy antisubmarine warfare officer.",
    "``There have been exercises going on in the Yellow Sea over the past two months,'' he said.",
    "``This boat could have been involved in those exercises and gone down over a month ago.''",
    "Cole said the loss of all hands suggested the vessel was flooded or sank because of a collision or engineering problem.",
    "He said Ming-class subs usually carry a crew of 50, suggesting that the others aboard might have been technicians or staff officers.",
    "China began building the Ming-class subs in the 1970s, and they are obsolete by modern standards, according to the Federation of American Scientists.",
    "The first three Ming-class subs were completed between 1971 and 1979, and one of them was scrapped after a fire, according to the Web site of Jane's Information Group, a leading of source defense information.",
    "China is believed to have as many as 19 Ming-class submarines.",
    "China's submarine fleet includes 66 boats, most of them aging diesel-electric vessels, McGinty said.",
    "He said the fleet suffers from a chronic lack of money, training and maintenance.",
    "But the Chinese are aggressively updating their fleet with Russian-made Kilo-class diesel-electric subs.",
    "``The submarine force is the most potent part of the Chinese navy,'' said Cole.",
    "Despite the difficulty of maintaining a fleet, subs are valuable because they are hard to detect, Cole said.",
    "In a conflict over Taiwan or some other confrontation, he said, ``China's ability to field a force of even a dozen submarines could pose a big problem for any other naval force.''",
    "Xinhua said former President Jiang Zemin, who is chairman of the commission that runs China's military, on Friday sent condolences to family members of the crew.",

    "Rashid said that Pakistan has very good relations with the brotherly country of Afghanistan.",
    "When asked to comment on the trans-national gas pipeline projects, he said, four countries including Qatar, Turkmenistan and Iran are deliberating upon the projects which will go a long way in strengthening the economies of the participating countries.",
    "Earlier on Thursday, President Pervez Musharraf said Pakistan wants peace and stability in Afghanistan as it would be in \"our interest.\"",
    "Pakistan, he said, would benefit immensely from stability in Afghanistan as its trade with Central Asian countries will take place through it.",
    "Referring to al-Qaeda, Musharraf said that no non-Pakistani would be allowed to live in Pakistan without proper documents.",

    "North Korea accuses the United States of planning to attack the communist country, which Bush has branded part of an ``axis of evil'' along with Iran and Iraq.",
    "It also revived its claim that the U.S. military keeps many nuclear weapons in South Korea, turning the country into ``the biggest nuclear advance base in the Far East.''",
    "Washington says it wants to use dialogue to resolve the nuclear crisis, although U.S. officials have not ruled out a military option.",
    "North Korea ``keenly felt that the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula would only remain as a daydream unless the U.S. drops its hostile policy toward the DPRK,'' KCNA said.",
    "It said the U.S. invasion of Iraq taught it that ``a war can be averted and the sovereignty of the country and the security of the nation can be protected only when a country has ... a strong military deterrent force capable of decisively repelling any attack to be made by any types of sophisticated weapons.''",
    "In New York, South Korean President Roh said he will never condone North Korea's nuclear development, but Seoul and Washington agree the nuclear standoff with the North must be solved peacefully ``by all means.''",
    "``It is incumbent upon Pyongyang to give up its nuclear project and come forward as a responsible member of the international community,'' he said.",
    "``When the North takes this route, the Republic of Korea and the international community will extend the necessary support and cooperation.''",
    "Julianne Lee, a Roh spokeswoman, said the North Korean statement might be a negotiating ploy in the wake of talks last month with U.S. officials in Beijing.",
    "During the talks in Beijing, U.S. officials said North Korea claimed it already possesses nuclear weapons, and that it had reprocessed 8,000 spent nuclear fuel rods  _  a move that could yield several atomic bombs within months.",
    "North Korea offered to drop its nuclear and missile programs in exchange for security guarantees and economic aid, according to U.S. officials.",
